== Introduction

This document presents a standardized control interface for RISC-V trace infrastructure (such as trace encoders, trace funnels, trace sinks, ...) for the _Efficient Trace for RISC-V Version 2.0 Specification_ and for the _RISC-V N-Trace (Nexus-based Trace) Specification Version 1.0.0_. Standardized control interface allows trace control software development tools to be used interchangeably with any RISC-V device implementing processor and/or data trace.

Instruction Trace is a system that collects a history of processor execution, along with other events. The trace system may be set up and controlled using a register-based interface. Hart execution activity appears on the Ingress Port and feeds into a Trace Encoder where it is compressed and formatted into trace messages. The Trace Encoder transmits trace messages to a Trace Sink. In multi-core systems, each hart has its own Trace Encoder, and typically all will connect to a Trace Funnel that aggregates the trace data from multiple sources and sends the data to a single destination.

This specification does not define the hardware interconnection between the hart and Trace Encoder, as this is defined in the _Efficient Trace for RISC-V Specification Version 2.0_. This document also does not define the hardware interconnection between the Trace Encoder and Trace Funnel, or between the Trace Encoder/Funnel and Trace Sink.

This specification allows a wide range of implementations including low-gate-count minimal instruction trace and systems with only instrumentation trace. Implementation choices include whether to support branch trace, data trace, instrumentation trace, timestamps, external triggers, various trace sink types, and various optimization tradeoffs between gate count, features, and bandwidth requirements.

=== Glossary

*Trace Encoder (TE for short)* - Hardware module that accepts execution information from a hart and generates a stream of trace messages/packets.

*Trace Message/Packet* - Depending on protocol different names can be used, but it means the same. It is considered as a continuous sequence of (usually bytes) describing program and/or data flow and other events.

*Trace Funnel* - Hardware module that combines trace streams from multiple trace sources (Trace Encoders and/or other Trace Funnels) into a single output stream of trace messages/packets.

*Trace Sink* - Hardware module that accepts a stream of trace messages/packets and records them into the memory or forwards them onward in some format.

*Trace Decoder* - Software program that takes a recorded trace (from a Trace Sink) and produces a readable execution history.

*RO* - Denotes read-only bit/field - it does not mean it will return the same value each time when read.

*RW* - Denotes read-write bit/field - value being read may not be the same as what was written as some fields may change their values because of other reasons.

*RW1C* - Denotes bit/field, which can be read but you must write 1 to clear it (writing 0 will be ignored). It is used for sticky status bits to assure that these are cleared by deliberate action (write 1). 

*WARL* - Denotes Write any, read legal bit/field/register. If a non-legal value is written, the written value is converted to a value that is supported. That value should deterministically depend on the illegal written value and the architectural state of the trace sub-system. 

*SD* - Reset value of a field/register is system dependent - these fields should always have the same values at trace component reset. In many cases this may be the only value supported.

*ATB* - Advanced Trace Bus, a protocol described in ARM document _AMBA ATB Protocol Specification_. This is one of alternative methods to send the trace (in addition to native Trace Sinks defined in this specification).

*PIB* - Pin Interface Block, a parallel or serial off-chip trace port feeding into a trace probe.

== Trace Protocols and Trace Control

There are two standard RISC-V trace protocols which will utilize this *RISC-V Trace Control Interface*:

[#N-Trace Specification]
* *RISC-V N-Trace (Nexus-based Trace) Specification* 
** Version 1.0.0 to be ratified together with this specification.

[#E-Trace Specification]
* *Efficient Trace for RISC-V Specification*
** At the moment of this writing this is version 2.0 (ratified May 5-th 2022).

This specification together with details provided in any of above documents should be considered as a complete guideline for any standard RISC-V trace implementation.

Trace is controlled by set of 32-bit registers.

Not all trace protocols and components must support all registers, bits, fields and options. This document includes a chapter <<Minimal Implementation,Minimal Implementation>> which describes the smallest possible set of registers and fields, but each message protocol supported by this standard must clarify the exact meaning of supported registers/fields and bits as some of them define.

== Trace System Overview

This section briefly describes features of the Trace Encoder and other trace components as background for understanding some of the control interface register fields.

=== Trace Encoder

By monitoring the Ingress Port, the Trace Encoder determines when a program flow discontinuity has occurred and whether the discontinuity is inferable or non-inferable. An inferable discontinuity is one for which the Trace Decoder can statically determine the destination, such as a direct branch instruction in which the destination or offset is included in the opcode. Non-inferable discontinuities include all other types as interrupt, exception, and indirect jump instructions.

==== Branch Trace Messaging

Branch Trace Messaging is the simplest form of instruction trace. Each program counter discontinuity results in one trace message, either a Direct or Indirect Branch Message. Linear instructions (or sequences of linear instructions) do not directly generate any trace messages/packets but overflow of counters (or exceptions) may generate corresponding packets/messages - these messages are infrequent and will not affect trace compression.

Indirect Branch Messages normally contain a compressed address to reduce bandwidth. The Trace Encoder emits a Branch With Sync Message containing the complete instruction address under certain conditions. This message type is a variant of the Direct or Indirect Branch Message and includes a full address and a field indicating the reason for the Sync.

==== Branch History Messaging

Both the Efficient Trace for RISC-V (E-Trace) Specification and the RISC-V N-Trace (Nexus-based Trace) specification define systems of messages intended to improve compression by reporting only whether conditional branches are taken by encoding each branch outcome in a single taken/not-taken bit. The destinations of non-inferable jumps and calls are reported as compressed addresses. Much better compression can be achieved, but an encoder implementation will typically require more hardware.

==== Other Optimizations

Several other optimizations are possible to improve trace compression. These are optional for any Trace Encoder and there should be a way to disable optimizations in case the trace system is used with code that does not follow recommended API rules. Examples of optimizations are a Return-address stack, Branch repetition, Statically-inferable jump, and Branch prediction.

=== Trace Sinks

The Trace Encoder transmits completed messages to a Trace Sink. This specification defines a number of different sink types, all optional, and allows an implementation to define other sink types. A Trace Encoder must have at least one sink or funnel attached to it.

NOTE: Trace messages/packets are sequences of bytes. In case of wider sink width, some padding/idle bytes (or additional formatting) may be added by particular sink. N-Trace format allows any number of idle bytes between messages.

==== SRAM Sink

The Trace Encoder packs trace messages into fixed-width trace words (usually bytes). These are then stored in a dedicated RAM, typically located on-chip, in a circular-buffer fashion. When the RAM has filled, it may optionally be stopped, or it may wrap and overwrite earlier trace data.

==== System Memory Sink

The Trace Encoder packs trace messages into fixed-width trace words (usually bytes). These are then stored in a range of system memory reserved for trace using a DMA-type bus controller in a circular-buffer fashion. When the memory range has been filled, it may optionally be stopped, or it may wrap and overwrite earlier trace data. This type of sink may also be used to transmit trace off-chip through, for example, a PCIe or USB port.

==== PIB Sink

The Trace Encoder sends trace messages to the PIB Sink. Each message is transmitted off-chip (as sequence of bytes) using a specific protocol described later.

=== ATB Bridge

The ATB Bridge allows sending RISC-V trace to Arm CoreSight infrastructure (instead of RISC-V compliant sink defined in this document) as an ATB initiator. ATB Bridge is not needed for RISC-V only systems.

ATB width is byte aligned (8, 16, 32, 64, 128) which allows transport of trace messages/packets defined as sequence of bytes.

=== Trace Funnel

The Trace Encoder may send trace messages to a Trace Funnel. The Funnel aggregates the trace from each of its inputs (either RISC-V Trace Encoder or another Trace Funnel) and sends the combined trace stream to its designated Trace Sink or ATB Bridge, which is one or more of the sink types above.

NOTE: It is assumed that each input to the funnel (Trace Encoder or another Trace Funnel) has a unique message source ID defined (`trTeSrcID` field in the `trTeControl` register).

== Trace Control Interface Overview

The Trace Control interface consists of a set of 32-bit registers. The control interface can be used to set up and control a trace session, retrieve collected trace, and control any trace system components.

=== Trace Components

Each Trace Component is controlled by a set of 32-bit registers occupying up to a 4KB space. Base address of each trace component must be aligned on the 4KB boundary.

Each hart being traced must have its own separate Trace Encoder control component. A system with multiple harts must allow generating messages with a field indicating which hart is responsible for that message.

This specification defines the following trace components (**__N__** in at the end of symbol name denotes 0-based index of particular component)

.*Trace Components*
[cols="30%,40%,30%",options="header",]
|===
|*Component Name* |*Component Type* (value=symbol)|*Base Address* (symbol #**__N__**)
|Trace Encoder |0x1=TRCOMP_ENCODER|trBaseEncoder**__N__**
|Trace Funnel |0x8=TRCOMP_FUNNEL|trBaseFunnel**__N__**
|Trace RAM Sink |0x9=TRCOMP_RAMSINK|trBaseRamSink**__N__**
|Trace PIB Sink |0xA=TRCOMP_PIBSINK|trBasePibSink**__N__**
|Trace ATB Bridge |0xE=TRCOMP_ATBBRIDGE|trBaseAtbBridge**__N__**
|===

NOTE: This specification is NOT addressing discovery of base addresses of trace components. These base addresses (symbols in above table) must be specified as part of trace tool configuration. Connections between different trace components must be also defined. Future versions of this specification may allow a single base address to be sufficient to access and discover all trace components in the system.

==== Connections Between Components

Different components must be connected via internal busses and/or FIFO buffers. This specification does not define this interconnect logic, but the following rules must be followed:

* Each component sending a trace message/packet must assure the entire packet can be accepted by the destination component (or pushed into the FIFO buffer).
** Sending a partial packet is NEVER allowed as it will not be possible to process and decode such a trace.
* If a component cannot send an entire message/packet it must wait until it will be possible to do so.
* Tracing is typically required to be non-intrusive, and if the Trace Encoder cannot keep up with the hart it should drop the packet and wait for the receiver to be ready.
** Once trace is allowed to resume it must issue an instruction trace synchronization message/packet so the decoder will be aware that some (unknown) amount of trace has been lost.
** It is advisable to drain the trace pipeline to some hysteresis level before resuming - otherwise a lot of short chunks of trace may be produced.
* Optionally the Trace Encoder may be configured to stall the hart in order to avoid trace data loss.
* To prevent trace overflows the following techniques can be used:
** Add a FIFO capable of holding several trace messages/packets to mitigate bursts of trace data.
** Use wider internal busses to provide more bandwidth.
** Make sure funnels and sinks provide the same or more bandwidth than encoders.
** Use triggers to create trace windows/ranges to limit amount of trace data - especially in multi-core configurations.

|Trace Funnel|Trace ATB Bridge|Sending combined trace from multiple harts to Arm ATB infrastructure

|Trace ATB Bridge |Arm ATB bus|Sending trace to ATB (to combine RISC-V trace with other Arm components on the system)
|===

NOTE: Sending RISC-V trace to Arm CoreSight infrastructure is allowed (via ATB Bridge), but this specification does not specify how to transport trace data from other Arm CoreSight components in the system using RISC-V Trace sub-system.
One of possible ways of doing so would be to create a custom trace component, configure it to encapsulate it as custom N-Trace trace messages and connect it as input to one of trace funnels.

Please in ditaa figures don't use the minus key '-' in your keyboard when
typing text (like 'non-privileged' in the figure below).
'-' is a special character that is used by ditaa to draw lines, not text.
Instead use a different unicode character that looks similar.
The figure below uses the unicode character with code U+2212 instead of the '-'
character of your keyboard (which has the unicode code U+002B).
Note that in your editor both probably look the same, but when rendered by
ditaa/asciidoc the '-' from your keyboard is used to draw a line, while the
alternative looks as a minus symbol.
If you don't know how to type an unicode character in your editor you might
simply copy the '−' character in the 'non−privileged' word from the drawing
below.

NOTE: Trace data from *Trace Encoder #4* may be combined with trace from other 3 Trace Encoders. But it may be also sent to dedicated *Trace RAM Sink* - in such a case corresponding input to *Trace Funnel (top)* should be disabled.

=== Accessing Trace Control Registers

For the access method to the trace control registers, it makes a difference whether these registers shall be accessed by an external debug/trace tool, or by an internal debugger running on the chip.

Trace control register access by an external debugger (this is the most common use case):

* External debuggers must be able to access all trace control registers independent of whether the traced harts are running or halted. That is why for external debuggers, the recommended access method for memory-mapped control registers is memory accesses through the RISC-V debug module using SBA (System Bus Access) as defined in the RISC-V Debug Specification.

Trace control register access by an internal debugger:

* Through loads and stores performed by one or more harts in the system. Mapping the control interface into physical memory accessible from a hart allows that hart to manage a trace session independently from an external debugger. A hart may act as an internal debugger or may act in cooperation with an external debugger. Two possible use models are collecting crash information in the field and modifying trace collection parameters during execution. If a system has physical memory protection (PMP), a range can be configured to restrict access to the trace system from hart(s).

NOTE: Additional control path(s) may also be implemented, such as extra JTAG registers or devices, a dedicated DMI debug bus or message-passing network. Such an access (which is NOT based on System Bus) may require custom implementation by trace probe vendors as this specification only mandates probe vendors to provide access via SBA commands.

[[register-map]]
=== Trace Component Register Map

Each  block of 32-bit registers (for each component) has the following layout:

.*Register Layout for Component*
[cols="10%,25%,15%,~",options="header",]
|===
|*Address Offset* |*Register Name* |*Compliance* |*Description*
|0x000 |tr??Control |Required |Main control register for this trace component
|0x004 |tr??Impl |Required |Trace Implementation information for this trace component
|0x008 - 0x00F |extra controls|Optional |Extra controls for this trace component (named differently)
|0x010 - 0xDFF |--|Optional |Additional registers (specific for particular type of component). All not used registers are reserved and should read as 0 and ignore writes.
|0xE00 - 0xFFF |--|Optional |Registers reserved for implementation/vendor specific details. May allow identification of components on a system bus.
|===

WARNING: Each component has a `tr??Active` bit in the `tr??Control` register. Accesses to other registers are unspecified when the `tr??Active` bit is 0. 

Each trace component has a `tr??Impl` register (at address offset 0x4) where trace component version and trace component type can be identified. This register allows debug tools to confirm the component type and potentially adjust tool behavior by looking at component versions.

NOTE: Each component may have a different version. Initial version of this specification defines all components to specify component version as 1.0 (major=1, minor=0).

Registers in the 4KB range that are not implemented are reserved and read as 0 and ignore writes.

Most trace control registers are optional. Some WARL fields may be hard-coded to any value (including 0). It allows different implementations to provide different functionality.

Both N-Trace and E-Trace encoders are controlled by the same set of bits/fields in the same `trTe???` registers - as almost every register, field, bit is optional this provides good flexibility in implementation.

All other trace components are shared between different trace encoders (N-Trace and E-Trace).

== Versioning of Components

Each component has a `tr??Impl` register, which includes two 4-bit `tr??VerMinor` and `tr??VerMajor` fields. These fields are guaranteed to be present in all future revisions of a standard, so trace tools will be able to discover a component version and act accordingly.

* Value 0 as `tr??VerMajor` is NOT allowed (due to compatibility reasons).
* Different components may report different versions (as some components may be updated more often than others).
* The major version `tr??VerMajor` field is incremented when the modification breaks backward compatibility.
* The minor version `tr??VerMinor` field  is incremented when the modification maintains backward compatibility (for example adding a new field) - for that reason software should always write 0 to undefined bits in registers. 
* Version 15.x is reserved for non-compatible version encoding.
* Version n.15 should be used as experimental (in development) implementation.

Software tools must report the version number as two decimal numbers __major.minor__ - initial version of this specification is defined as *__1.0__*.

[NOTE]
====

Trace software should handle versions as follows (let's assume hypothetical version 2.3 was defined as current version in moment of release of trace software)

* 0.x => Reject as not supported or generate a warning and handle as pre-ratified/initial version 0.
* 2.3 => Accept silently.
* 2.2 => Accept silently (and trim features or not allow users to set newer features).
* 2.4 => Generate a warning but continue using 2.3 features.
* 2.15 => Generate an "experimental version" warning but continue using 2.3 features.
* 1.x => Generate a warning and continue or reject as an obsolete (referring to last debugger supporting this version).
* 3.x => Generate a fatal error that this future version is not compatible with existing software and possibly redirect to the tool update page.

Displayed messages should report component name, component base address and current and supported version numbers. It is suggested to display the full hexadecimal value of `tr??Impl` register as it may aid in debugging of possibly incorrect/incompatible component configuration.

== Trace Encoder Control Interface

Many features of the Trace Encoder (TE for short) are optional. In most cases, optional features are enabled using a WARL (write any, read legal) register field. A debugger can determine if an optional feature is present by writing to the register field and reading back the result.

|0 |trTeActive |Primary activate/reset bit for the TE. When 0, the TE may have clocks gated off or be powered
down, and other register locations may be inaccessible. Hardware may take an arbitrarily long time to process power-up and power-down and will indicate completion when the read value of this bit matches what was written. See <<Reset and Discovery,Reset and Discovery>> chapter for more details.|RW |0

Setting `trTeEnable` to 0 flushes any queued trace data to the sink or funnel attached to this encoder. This bit can be set to 1 only by direct writing to it. This write of 1 should be done after all other settings are done. See <<Enabling and Disabling,Enabling and Disabling>> chapter for more details.|RW |0

|2 |trTeInstTracing |*1:* Instruction trace is being generated. Written from a trace tool (after a write to `trTeEnable`) or controlled by triggers. When `trTeInstTracing=1`, instruction trace data may be subject to additional filtering in some implementations (additional `trTeInstMode` settings). |RW |0

=== Timestamp Unit

Timestamp Unit is an optional sub-component present in either Trace Encoder or Trace Funnel. An implementation may choose from several modes of timestamps: 

* *Internal System* - fixed clock in a system (such as bus clock) is used to increment the timestamp counter (for both Trace Encoders and Trace Funnels)
* *Internal Core* - core clock is used to increment the timestamp counter (only for Trace Encoders)
* *Shared* - shares timestamp with another Trace Encoder or Trace Funnel
* *External* - accepts a binary timestamp value from an outside source such as ARM CoreSight(TM) trace (for both Trace Encoders and Trace Funnels)

Implementations may have no timestamp, one timestamp mode, or more than one mode. The WARL field `trTsMode`` is used to determine the system capability and to set the desired timestamp mode.

The width of the timestamp is implementation-dependent, typically 40 or 48 bits (40 bit timestamp will overflow every 4.7 minutes assuming 1GHz timestamp clock).

In a system with Funnels, typically all the Funnels are built with a Timestamp Unit. The top-level Funnel is the source of the timestamp (Internal System or External) and all the Encoders and other Funnels have a Shared timestamp. This assures that all timestamps in the system are the same and trace from different harts may be time-correlated. To perform the forwarding function, the mid-level Funnels must be programmed with `trFunnelActive` = 1 (which is natural as all trace messages must pass through that funnel).

An Internal System or Core timestamp unit may include a timestamp clock pre-scaler divider, which can extend the range of a narrower timestamp and uses less power but has less resolution.

In a system with an Internal Core timestamp counter (implemented in Trace Encoder associated with a hart) an optional control bit is provided to stop the counter when the hart is halted by a debugger.

=== Trace Encoder Triggers

==== Debug Trigger Module

Debug module triggers are signals from the hart that a trigger was hit, but the action associated with that trigger is a trace-related action. Action identifiers 2-5 are reserved for trace actions in the RISC-V Debug Specification, where triggers are defined. Actions 2-4 are defined by the Efficient Trace for RISC-V (E-Trace) Specification. The desired action is written to the `action` field of the Match Control `mcontrol` CSR (0x7a1). As not all harts may support all trace actions, the debugger should read back the `mcontrol` CSR after setting the desired trace action to verify that the option exists.

|5 |*Vendor-specific action* (optional)

==== External Trace Triggers

The TE may be configured with up to 8 external trigger inputs for controlling trace. These are in addition to the external triggers present in the Debug Module when Halt Groups are implemented. The specific hardware signals comprising an external trigger are implementation-dependent.

External Trigger Outputs may also be present. A trigger out may be generated by trace starting, trace stopping, a watchpoint, or by other system-specific events.

|===

==== Triggers Precedence

It is implementation-dependent what happens when triggers (from debug module or external) with conflicting actions occur simultaneously (signaled at the same ingress port cycle) or if triggers occur too frequently to process.

It is recommended that tracing starts from the oldest instruction retired in the cycle that Trace-on is asserted, and stops following the newest instruction retired in the cycle that Trace-off is asserted.

=== Trace Encoder Filter Registers

All registers with offsets 0x400 .. 0x7FC are designated for additional trace encoder filter options (context, addresses, modes, etc.).

Trace encoder filters are an optional feature that can be used to control the generated trace in various ways.

The registers below divide the filter logic into filters and comparators to provide maximum flexibility at low cost. The number of filters and comparators depends on the system. Each filter unit can specify filtering against instruction and optionally against data trace inputs from the hart. When filter __i__ is implemented, the registers `trTeFilter__i__Control` and `trTeInstFilters` must be implemented to enable it. And to apply filter __i__ to the data trace, the `trTeDataFilters` register must also be present. And if a match bit in the `trTeFilter__i__Control` register can be set to 1 (= enabling a filter option), the corresponding register from the bit's description must have a correct value already set as otherwise the trigger may fire unintentionally. Each of the mentioned comparator units is actually a pair of comparators (primary and secondary, or P and S), so a limited range can be matched with a single comparator unit if needed.

NOTE: Filter and comparator registers refer to values of some signals (as *priv*, *itype*, *ecause*, *dtype*, *dsize*, ...) available on Trace Ingress Port. See E-Trace specification for details of encoding of these values.

== Trace RAM Sink

Trace RAM Sink may be instantiated or configured to support storing trace into dedicated SRAM or system memory. SRAM mode is using dedicated local memory inside of RAM sink, while system memory mode (SMEM mode) is accessing memory via system bus (care should be taken to not overwrite application code or data - it is usually done by reserving part of system memory for trace). Dedicated SRAM memory must be read via dedicated `trRamData` register, while memory in SMEM mode should be read as any other memory on system bus - for example using SBA (System Bus Access) access mode as defined in the RISC-V Debug Specification.

Trace data is placed in memory in LSB order (first byte of trace packet/data is placed on LSB).

Be aware that in case trace memory wraps around some protocols may require additional synchronization data - it is usually done by periodically generating a sequence of alignment synchronization bytes which cannot be part of any valid packet. Specification of each trace protocol must define it.

NOTE: When trace capture was wrapped around (`trRamWrap` = 1) beginning of trace is not available and oldest packets/messages in the trace buffer (starting at address in `trRamWP`) will be most likely not complete.

Table below shows typical Trace RAM Sink configurations. Implementing other configurations is not suggested as trace tools may not support it without adjustments.

.*Typical Trace RAM Sink Configurations*

|===
|*Mode*      |*trRamStart* |*trRamLimit* |*trRamWP* |*trRamRP* |*trRamData*
|SRAM        |0 |Hard coded to max size (2^M - A) at reset, but can be possibly trimmed|Required  |Required |Required
|SMEM Generic |Any (2^N aligned) |Any (`trRamStart` + 2^M - A) - must be set by trace tool |Required  |Not implemented|Not implemented
|SMEM Fixed   |Fixed (2^N aligned) |Fixed to max size at reset (`trRamStart` + 2^M - A), but can be possibly trimmed |Required  |Not implemented|Not implemented
|===

NOTE: Value `A` means alignment which depends on memory access width. If we have memory access width of 32-bits, A=4 and value of `trRamLimit` register should be 0x...FC. Some implementations may impose bigger alignment of trace data (to allow more efficient transfer rates) for SMEM mode. For SRAM mode `A` must be 4 as access to trace via `trRamData` is always 32-bits wide.

=== Accessing and Detecting RAM Sink Registers 

Trace tool should start interacting with Trace RAM Sink by releasing RAM Sink from reset by setting `trRamActive` = 1 and waiting for this bit to be set. After that it should verify `trRamEmpty` = 1, read `trRamImpl` and verify `trRamCompType` and `trRamVer??` fields. Values of `trRamHasSRAM/SMEM` fields will provide main types of RAM Sink being implemented.

Later `trRamMode` should be set (depending on desired RAM Sink mode). It is important to set this field first as other registers may behave differently for SRAM and SMEM modes.

In SRAM mode, the trace memory is dedicated for trace storage and `trRamStart??` registers should not be settable (usually both not implemented and return 0). `trRamLimitLow` register may be either hardcoded (to reflect physical SRAM size) or writable (allowing trimming RAM size allowing faster wrap-around or sharing same memory with some other components in the system). The `trRamLimitHigh` register should not be implemented as it is not practical to have more than 4GB of dedicated on-chip RAM storage.

Detection of valid ranges of each `trRamStart??` and `trRamLimit??` registers should be performed by writing 0 and 0xFFFFFFFF.
After setting 0, the lowest possible value must be set. After setting 0xFFFFFFFF the highest possible value must be set. If the highest value for `trRamStartHigh` or `trRamLimitHigh` is 0, it means the register is NOT implemented.

Some implementations may provide different limits for different start addresses, so the trace tool should always set `trRamStart??` registers first - this option can be used when a particular implementation has two different RAM regions (each with different physical memory size).

Not every value may be settable in `trRamStart/Limit` registers. Value written may be trimmed (for example aligned on a particular 2^N boundary) and a trace tool should verify values being written. In case accepted values are different from what was provided by the user, a message should be printed which may allow the user to adjust (possbly suboptimal) settings.

Registers `trRamStart??` and `trRamLimit??` are usually set at the beginning of a debug/trace session and never changed. 

IMPORTANT: In SMEM mode (`trRamMode` = 1) trace tool should never set `trRamStart??` and `trRamLimit??` registers outside of range provided by the user as otherwise raw trace being written to memory may corrupt running code and/or data or stack. This type of errors may be very difficult to diagnose as in complex system code (or data) being overwritten by trace may be used way, way later after actual corruption was made.

Having both `trRamStart/Limit??` registers set, the tool should try to set `trRamRP??` to the same value as `trRamLimit??`. If it is settable it means that the `trRamData` register should be used to read the trace. Otherwise collected trace must be read using normal, physical memory accesses (in range defined by `trRamStart/Limit??` registers).

Before enabling RAM Trace Sink (by setting `trRamEnable` = 1) the trace tool should set `trRamWP??` registers (usually to the same values as in `trRamStart??` register). Enabling trace must NOT change any of `trRamStart/Size/WP/RP??` registers. Just after the trace is enabled `trRamWP??` may change as a result of trace being added to trace memory.

After trace is enabled and active (`trRamEnable` = 1 or `trRamEmpty` = 0), the trace tool should NOT write any of `trRamStart/Limit/WP??` registers.

Setting `trRamRP` and reading `trRamData` may be attempted while trace is active, but support for reading SRAM trace while trace is active may not always be implemented. In such a case write to `trRamRP` must be ignored and `trRamData` read must not advance `trRamRP`. Reading the trace in the SMEM mode via normal memory reads is always allowed.

NOTE: Even if reading trace (while trace is active) is implemented, circular trace buffer may be overwritten even several times, so values being read by `trRamData` will be of no use. However when trace is started/stopped by infrequent triggers, reading SRAM trace may be useful. However the very last packet in memory may be incomplete as the last trace word may be buffered inside (and `trRamEmpty` = 0 will be observed).

NOTE: Trace RAM Sink may implement writing trace by writing to `trRamData`, but this mode is usable only for testing, so will most likely not be implemented. Trace tool is not required to support writing to the `trRamData` register.


== Trace Funnel

The Trace Funnel combines messages/packets from multiple sources into a single trace stream. It is implementation-dependent how many incoming messages/packets are accepted before it is switching to another input source and in what order. But a continuous stream of messages/packets at one input cannot cause other inputs to not be handled. Suggested implementation would be to process just a single message/packet from each input in a round-robin fashion.

NOTE: `trFunnelDisInput` register is optional. When not implemented (or never set) it will read as 0, which means that all inputs are always enabled. When implemented, it can be set to 0xFFFF to detect which inputs may be disabled in that trace funnel. Disabling inputs is needed when a single trace encoder may provide output to more than one possible active destination/sink. This register can be also used by trace tools to easily configure a trace in complex systems. Without the ability to disable individual funnel inputs, the trace tool must assure all trace sources which should not be traced are disabled.

=== Timestamp Unit

Trace Funnel may optionally include Timestamp Unit. It is described inside of the Trace Encoder chapter above.

== Trace PIB Sink

Trace data may be sent to chip pins through an interface called the Pin Interface Block (PIB). This interface typically operates at a few hundred MHz and can sometimes be higher with careful constraints and board layout or by using LVDS or other high-speed signal protocol. PIB may consist of just one signal and in this configuration may be called SWT (Serial-Wire Trace). Alternative configurations include a trace clock (TRC_CLK) and  1/2/4/8/16 parallel trace data signals (TRC_DATA) timed to that trace clock. WARL register fields are used to determine specific PIB capabilities.

The modes and behavior described here are intended to be compatible with trace probes available in the market.

|===

Since the PIB supports many different modes, it is necessary to follow a particular programming sequence:

* Activate the PIB by setting `trPibActive`.
* Set the `trPibMode`, `trPibDivider`, `trPibClkCenter`, and `trPibCalibrate` fields. This will set the TRC_DATA outputs to the quiescent state (whether that is high or low depends on `trPibMode`) and start TRC_CLK running.
* Activate the receiving device, such as a trace probe. Allow time for PLL to sync up, if using a PLL with a parallel PIB mode.
* Set `trPibEnable`. This enables the PIB to generate output either immediately (calibration mode) or when the Trace Encoder or Trace Funnel begins sending trace messages/packets.

=== Order of bits and bytes

* Trace messages/packets are considered as sequences of bytes and are always transmitted with least significant bits/bytes first.
* In 16-bit mode (`trPibMode` == 12) the byte transmitted on bits #0-#7 is considered first and most significant bits#8-#15 are transmitting second byte.
* Idle sequences (no message/packet to be sent) are transmitted between messages.
** Idle sequence depends on trace protocol and must allow detection of the start of first byte of message/packet following the idle sequence. 
** Idle sequences may be different and should be defined by trace protocols.

=== PIB Parallel Protocol

Traditionally, off-chip trace has used this protocol. There are a number of parallel data signals (TRC_DATA0..15) and one continuously-running trace clock (TRC_CLK). The data rate of several parallel signals can be much higher than either of the serial-wire protocols.

This protocol is oriented to send full, variable length trace messages/packets rather than fixed-width trace words. 

When a message start is detected, this sample and possibly the next few (depending on the width of TRC_DATA) are collected until a complete byte has been received. Bytes are transmitted least significant bit first, with TRC_DATA[0] representing the least significant bit in each beat of data. The receiver continues collecting bytes until a complete message has been received. The criteria for this depends on the trace format. After the last byte of a message, the data signals may then go to their idle state or a new message may begin in the next trace clock edge.

==== PIB Clock Center

The trace clock, TRC_CLK, normally has edges coincident with the TRC_DATA edges. Typically, a trace probe will delay trace data or use a PLL to recover a sampling clock that is twice the frequency of TRC_CLK and shifted 90 degrees so that its rising edges occur near the center of each bit period. If the PIB implementation supports it, the debugger can set `trPibClkCenter` to change the timing of TRC_CLK so that there is a TRC_CLK edge at the center of each bit period on TRC_DATA. Note that this option cuts the data rate in half relative to normal parallel mode and still requires the probe to sample TRC_DATA on both edges of TRC_CLK.

This example shows 8-bit parallel mode with `trPibClkCenter` = 0 transmitting a 5-byte message/packet followed by a 2-byte message/packet.

And an example showing 8-bit parallel mode transmitting a 4-byte packet with `trPibClkCenter` = 1  

image:./RISC-V-Trace-Control-Interface-images/pib-ref1.png[image]

=== Calibration Mode

In optional calibration mode, the PIB transmits a repeating pattern. Probes can use this to automatically tune input delays due to skew on different PIB signal lines and to adjust to the transmitter's data rate (`trPibDivider` and `trPibClkCenter`). Calibration patterns for each mode are listed below.

NOTE: Calibration mode may be used even by probes which do not support calibration of trace just to assure trace routing on PCB is correct and PIB is correctly enabled. It may be also possible to use calibration mode to check trace signal routing from SoC using scope or logic analyzer.

=== SWT Manchester Protocol

In this mode, the PIB outputs complete trace messages encapsulated between a start bit and a stop bit. Each bit period is divided into 2 phases and the sequential values of the TRC_DATA[0] pin during those 2 phases denote the bit value. Bits of the message are transmitted LSB first. The idle state of TRC_DATA[0] is low in this mode.

=== SWT UART Protocol

In UART protocol, the PIB outputs bytes of a trace message encapsulated in a 10-bit packet consisting of a low start bit, 8 data bits, LSB first, and a high stop bit. Another packet may begin immediately following the stop bit or there may be an idle period between packets. When no data is being sent, TRC_DATA[0] is high in this mode.

== Trace ATB Bridge

Some SoCs may have an Advanced Trace Bus (ATB) infrastructure to manage trace produced by other components. In such systems, it may be desired to route entire RISC-V trace stream to the ATB through an ATB Bridge. This module manages the interface to ATB, generating ATB trace records that encapsulate RISC-V trace produced by the Trace Encoder[s] and/or Trace Funnel[s]. There is a control register that includes trace on/off control and a field allowing software to set the ID to be used on the ATB bus. This ID allows software to extract entire RISC-V trace from the combined trace. This interface is compatible with AMBA 4 ATB v1.1.

An implementation determines the data widths of the connection from the Trace Encoder or Trace Funnel and of the ATB port.

ATB Bridge may optionally insert ATB alignment synchronization packets (controlled by `trAtbBridgeAsyncFreq` field) which allow trace decoding software to detect ATB packet boundaries. Not all protocols may require it. 

== Additional Material

=== Minimal Implementation

This (non-normative) chapter gives an of what needs to be done to put together complete RISC-V trace implementation without getting familiar with every detail of every register.

*Minimal General Registers/Fields*

These requirements are applicable to the entire trace sub-system.

* One `Trace Encoder` per hart being traced is required.
* At least one of Trace RAM or Trace PIB sinks or Trace ATB Bridge is required as the final destination of an encoded RISC-V trace.
** Implementations providing custom transport only are NOT considered fully compliant with this specification as custom trace tools will be needed.
* Each trace component in a system is required to implement `tr??Control` and `tr??Impl` registers.
** `tr??Active` bit must be settable to 0 or 1, although reset itself is NOT required.
** `tr??Enable` bit must be settable to 0 or 1 and must support flushing (if applicable) when changed from 1 to 0.
** `tr??Empty` bit must read as 0 when the trace component has some trace data internally buffered (if trace component it not buffering any trace data, this bit may be hard-coded to 1).
** `tr??VerMajor`, `tr??VerMinor` and `tr??CompType` must be implemented.

*Minimal Trace Encoder Register/Fields*

* Bit `trTeInstTracing` must be implemented (to start/stop instruction trace output from Trace Encoder).
* One of `trTeInstMode` = 3 (Branch Trace) or 6 (History Trace) must be implemented (can be a hard-coded value).
* At least one of the non-0 values of `trTeInstSyncMode` must be settable (or hard-coded).
* Field `trTeFormat` must correspond to implemented trace protocol (0 for E-Trace or 1 for N-Trace).
* Fields `trTeProtocolMajor` and `trTeProtocolMinor` must return versions of implemented protocol.
* All other registers/fields/bits may be tied to 0.

*Minimal Trace RAM Sink Register/Fields*

SRAM mode only:

* Bit `trRamHasSRAM` must be tied to 1 and `trRamMode` must be tied to 0. 
* Bit `trRamWrap` must be implemented.
* Register `trRamLimitLow` must be implemented, but can be hard coded to value '2^M-4' (address 0x..FC).
* Register `trRamWPLow` must at least accept a write of 0.
* Register `trRamRPLow` must accept any 32-bit aligned value in inclusive range < 0 .. `trRamLimitLow` >.
** If width of access to SRAM is wider than 32-bits any 32-bit aligned value of `trRamRP` must be allowed and reads must be buffered.
* Register `trRamData` may be implemented for reading only.
* All other registers/fields/bits may be tied to 0.

SMEM mode only:

* Bit `trRamHasSMEM` must be tied to 1 and `trRamMode` must be tied to 1.
* Bit `trRamWrap` must be implemented.
* Register `trRamStart` must be implemented, but can be hard coded to value '2^N' (address 0x..00).
* Register `trRamLimit` must be implemented, but can be hard coded to value '2^N + 2^M-4' (address 0x..FC).
* Registers `trRamWP` must accept any 32-bit aligned value in inclusive range < `trRamStart` .. `trRamLimit` >.
* All other registers/fields/bits may be tied to 0.

*Minimal Trace PIB Sink Register/Fields*

It is hard to define required mode as it depends on SoC bandwidth requirements and capabilities, but some general guidance may be provided.

* 4-bit mode is supported by most (if not all) trace probes and less expensive MIPI20 connectors can be used.
** 1-bit and 2-bit modes should be only used when there are critical constraints on the number of MCU pins. Not all trace probes may support these modes. 
* Serial mode should be only considered when either limited trace is required or cores run slowly. Not all trace probes may support this mode and max allowed speeds may vary.
** Manchester encoding is self-synchronizing and may provide a more reliable trace. However UART mode may provide better bandwidth. It is suggested to support both.
* 8-bit and 16-bit modes will provide better bandwidth, but require a more expensive Mictor connector and only more advanced trace probe models may support it.
* It is suggested to provide as fast as possible trace logic clock, and allow a trace tool to set the divider in the `trPibDivider` field.
* For TRC_CLK frequencies higher than 50MHz, it is suggested to provide a calibration mode.
** If possible implement `trPibClkCenter` for better flexibility.

*Minimal ATB Bridge Register/Fields*

* Field `trAtbBridgeID` must be settable by trace tool (hard-coded ID may not be handled by all trace tools).

=== Reset and Discovery

This chapter describes what trace tools should do to reset and discover trace features. 

IMPORTANT: Trace tools must be provided with base addresses of all trace components.

There are several (independent) reset bits defined by this specification:

* `trTeActive` - reset for Trace Encoder component (this will disable encoder from single hart)
* `trFunnelActive` - reset for Trace Funnel component
* `trPibActive` - reset for PIB component (resets Pin Interface Block only)
* `trRamActive` - reset for RAM component (resets RAM Sink only)
* `trAtbBridgeActive` - resets ATB Bridge component (resets ATB Bridge interface)
* `trTsActive` - resets the Timestamp Unit sub-component (resets timestamp generation logic)

These reset bits should (when kept low) reset most of other registers/fields/bits to defined reset values.

Releasing components from reset may take time - debug tools should monitor (with reasonable timeout) if the appropriate bit actually changed from 0 to 1. Other fields/bits should remain unchanged (as were set during reset).

NOTE: Some of the reset values are defined as `SD` (system dependent) and these values should reset as well and each time to the same value as would be after power-up.

NOTE: Some bigger registers (holding RAM addresseses) may not reset - debugger is expected to write to them before enabling trace. These registers have `Undef` specified in reset behavior of the field. It should not prevent some implementations from resetting these.

Reset and Discovery should be performed as follows:

* Reset the component by setting `tr??Active` = 0.
* Read-back and wait until `tr??Active` = 0 is read.
* Release from reset by setting `tr??Active` = 1 and wait for `tr??Active` = 1 to be read (to confirm component is not in reset). 

IMPORTANT: When performing a write which is setting `tr??Active` = 1, no other bits should be changed (read-modify write is recommended)

* Optionally save `tr??Control` register as it holds all reset values of all fields. It may be cached/shadowed and trace tool may execute faster write-only (intead a read-modify-write) operations.
* Handle `tr??VerMinor/Major` as described in 'Versioning of Components' chapter.
** If `tr??VerMajor` is 0 (for Trace Encoder component) either handle it as pre-ratified/initial version 0 or generate fatal error with an appropriate error message.
* Read `tr??Impl` and compare `tr??ComType` field with expected value.
* Set some WARL fields and read back to discover supported component configuration - make sure the component is NOT enabled (by setting `tr??Enable` = 1) by mistake.
* Configure some initial values in all needed registers/fields. Read-back each one to assure these are set properly.

As we are dealing with several independent components, it is important to assure that the component which is in reset (or powered down) is keeping its outputs on safe values, so garbage trace data is not emitted.

In general it is safer to power-up and enable components starting from sinks/bridges, followed by Funnel and Encoder as last. Each implementation should test this sequence.

=== Enabling and Disabling

Enabling should work as follows:

* Release all needed components from reset by setting `tr??Active` = 1 as described above.
* Set desired mode and verify if that mode is set (regardless of discovery results).
* For RAM Sink:
** Setup needed addresses (if possible and desired) as these may not reset.
* For PIB Sink:
** Calibrate PIB (if possible and desired).
** Start physical trace capture (trace probe dependent).
* Configure RAM Sink/PIB Sink/ATB Bridge in appropriate mode.
** Verify if a particular mode is set.
* Set main enable for RAM Sink/PIB Sink/ATB Bridge component by setting `tr??Enable` = 1.
** Read back and wait for confirmation (`tr??Enable` = 1).
* Enable Trace Funnel[s] in the same way.
* Configure and Enable Trace Encoder[s] in the same way (last should be write of `trTeEnable` = 1 followed by read to verify that it is set).
* Either  manually set `trTeInstTracing=1` and/or `trTeDataTracing=1` bits or set triggers to start the trace.
* Start hart[s] to be traced (hart could be already running as well - in this case trace will be generated in the moment when `trTeInstTracing` or `trTeDataTracing` bit is set).
* Periodically read `trTeControl` for status of trace (as it may stop by itself due to triggers).
** If RAM Sink was configured with `trRamStopOnWrap` = 1, read `trRamEnable` to see if RAM capture was stopped. 

NOTE: Discovery may not be necessary to enable and test the trace during development of SoC. However discovery must be possible and should be tested by SoC designer - this is necessary for trace tools to work with that SoC without any customization.

NOTE: Trace tools may verify a particular setting once per session, so subsequent starts of trace may be faster.

NOTE: Trace tools should provide configuration settings allowing more verbose logging mode during discovery and initialization, so potential compatibility issues may be solved.

Disabling the trace should work as follows:

* It is essential to disable the trace from encoders associated with stopped harts as entering debug mode is NOT flushing any trace pipelines.
* Disable and flush trace starting from Encoders, then Funnels and finally Sinks or Bridges.
** Set `tr??Enable` = 0 and wait for `tr??Enable` = 0 and `tr??Empty` = 1 for each trace component.
** It is important to do it in that order as otherwise data may be lost.
* Stop physical capture if PIB sink was enabled (trace probe dependent).
* Read the trace.
** For RAM Trace Sink read `trRamWP` - depending on `trRamWrap` bit, you may read trace from two ranges.
** For RAM Trace Sink in SRAM mode, set `trRamRP` and read `trRamData` multiple times.
** For RAM Trace Sink in SMEM mode, read trace from system memory using memory read.
** For PIB Trace Sink read trace from trace probe.
** For ATB Bridge, read trace using Coresight components (ETB/TMC/TPIU).

Decoding trace

* Decoder (in most cases) must have an access to code which is running on device either by reading it from device or from a file containing the code (binary/hex/srec/ELF).
* The trace collected by trace probes can be read and decoded while a trace is being captured (this is called trace streaming mode).
** There is no guarantee that the last trace packet is completed until the trace is properly flushed and disabled.
* Decoding of the trace should never affect code being traced.

=== Pre-ratified/Initial Interface Version

Value of `trTeVerMajor` as 0 means this is the pre-ratified/initial version of this trace control interface.

Initially this specification was kept highly compatible, but after the decision to split all components into 4K regions it was very hard to track and list all changes and appropriate chapter was removed.

The migration path from 'ver 0' (for both IP providers and tool vendors) should not be hard as the main concepts remain unchanged.

Original donation from SiFive (which describes implementation of pre-ratified/initial version 0) can be found here:

IMPORTANT: Not all trace tools may support pre-ratified/initial version 0. But all such tools should reject the version 0 with a very clear message.
